Welcome to the first edition of **Tunes Tuesday**, where I talk about some of my listening habits, finds and recommendations for the week. Prepare to be taken on a chaotic journey, travelling from Smooth Jazz to Hardstyle, making many stops in-between! I hope to cover music for different moods, so that I can have your back through the highs and the lows, the busy and the calm, and in the times where you don't care either way.

I'm running out of terribly silly preamble, so without further ado, welcome to Tunes Tuesday and enjoy the stay! Letâ€™s find you an earworm for this week.

## House and Breakbeat for my work week

This week, I've probably spent most of my working days listening to House and Breakbeat Original Sound Tracks (OSTs). I've been particularly keen on the soundtrack from R4: Ridge Racer Type 4, an arcade racing game by Namco released in 1998, and am listening to it as a write this post. It seems my upcoming trip to Japan has triggered a need for nostalgia, given a large part of my childhood was based around playing Nintendo games with a similar, perhaps less beat heavy, genre of music. 

I'd argue that this is the perfect type of "background" music for when you are in a good mood and want to get on with some work. There are little to no lyrics, a consistent beat, and enough sound to keep you engaged without being overwhelmed. I wouldn't recommend it as much if you want something a bit more involved, such as singing your heart out in the car, but I have been enjoying it while coding and reading.

I'm slowly compiling a playlist of songs that I feel fit the vibe, with the vibe being a slightly more serious but still fun Mario Kart soundtrack. If you'd like to explore this, check out the playlist below:

## Gym Hype

To be honest, there is one clear winner this week when it comes to my gym hype song, and that is **EVIL J0RDAN** by Playboi Carti. Yes, the song takes a minute or so before the hype hits, but I find that's a perfect time to prepare and hit the weights as the beat drops. I wouldn't say it's a great song, and I can't understand half of what he is saying, but the drop makes up for the whole song in my opinion. Maybe I have just been brainwashed by the German guy Sigmaboy that drags his JBL speaker everywhere, I'm not sure.

If rap isn't your thing, then how about some house? I have been struggling to find some good house tracks for working out at the moment, but one that I have quite enjoyed is **Out Of My Head - TR779** by Martin Ikin and Grant Nelson. It's relatively short, but I think it has a good drop and I also really like the "radio-like" outro; perhaps it reminds me of when I used to listen to Capital Radio on the way to school. I find that if you set your Crossfader on Spotify just right (~8 seconds), you can have another track blend in really nicely with this one, which adds to the whole "radio vibe".

## Random picks

Because I've been doing a lot of "background" listening this week, I have found it difficult to identify specific songs that have caught my attention. One that has caught my attention, however, is **Otis** by Jay-Z, Kanye West and Otis Reading. Perhaps the opposite to EVIL J0RDAN, I find the first ~45 seconds of this song to be the best bit. Picture this: the sun is shining, you've just picked up a Minecraft Meal and got the Purple Grimace Egg, and you go outside to see some nice mountains in the distance. Pair this experience with the start of the song, and you've got yourself a perfect moment. The rest of the song isn't half bad either, but it's really the introduction that makes it shine.

Finally, and perhaps embarrassingly, the other song that has been stuck in my head is **Canary** by Hydraa. If you are foolish enough to play the track, and have a sufficient amount of brainrot from the internet, you may recognise that one of the backing sounds is from the "oo ii ii aa" cat that spins around. To be honest, the song isn't terrible, and would probably slot in secretly to one of my background playlists, however I cannot get the image of the rotating cat (I think his name is Maxwell) out of my head. I hope you at least mildly enjoy this song, otherwise I am sorry!

## Outro

Thanks for reading along to my first Tunes Tuesday. I hope you have enjoyed my over-analysed takes on some songs, and I promise next time I'll exclude any songs that have memes in them! As this is the first post, I'm still experimenting with the length and will hopefully offer a more refined version, but until then, I hope you have an excellent week and groove away to some great tunes!
